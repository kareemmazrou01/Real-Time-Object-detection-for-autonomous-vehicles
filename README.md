## Idea
Build an object detection model specifically tailored for autonomous vehicles to detect and classify objects (pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, obstacles) in real time.

## Description
This project gathers and processes datasets from sources like KITTI and COCO, then develops a real-time object detection model using fast and efficient architectures such as YOLO or SSD. The key challenges include:
- Handling varying environmental conditions.
- Ensuring high detection accuracy (using metrics like mAP and IoU).
- Achieving rapid inference speeds (measured in FPS).

The solution is integrated into an autonomous vehicle system with continuous monitoring and MLOps pipelines to manage performance in dynamic driving scenarios.
